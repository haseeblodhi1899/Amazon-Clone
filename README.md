# Amazon Clone

This project is a clone of the Amazon website, built using HTML and CSS. It represents my first front-end/clone project, providing a learning experience in web development.

## Introduction

This is an Amazon clone project implemented purely in front-end, using only HTML for structuring the content and CSS for styling.  It aims to replicate the basic layout and some functionalities of the Amazon website, which makes it a very practical exercise in web development fundamentals.  This is my first attempt at creating a clone project, and it has helped me understand the structure and styling of a real-world website.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the content of the website.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout of the web pages.

## Disclaimer

The project is an academic one. It is not a commercial one, and I am not asserting any ownership over Amazon or any rights to its properties.  This is a clone and is essentially a demonstration of my knowledge of HTML and CSS. I do not use it in any way that could be contended to infringe on Amazon's intellectual properties.
